## RogueLike-by-Godot
This is the first game I've tried making with a game engine, and I chose godot because it was easy to understand. During that time, I was very addicted to rogue-like games, such as vampire survivors, so I wanted to try creating a game in the same genre to increase my understanding of system design and practice writing code myself.
However, the code is not well optimized and somewhat strange since it is the first game. I apologize in advance.
